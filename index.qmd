Hello, I am Romain Fernex, a first-year student of the [Master in Economics](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/) at [SciencesPo Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/fr/). 
Before I joined this master, I graduated in management, with a major in finance, from [ESCP Europe](https://escp.eu) and [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do). 
I am mainly interested in the topic of inequalities, environmental economics and health economics. 
Countrywise, I have a keen interest for the East Asian area (notably South Korea and Japan).
