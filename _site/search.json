Before I joined this master, I graduated in management, with a major in finance, from ESCP Europe and Korea University. I am mainly interested in the topic of inequalities, environmental economics and health economics. Countrywise, I have a keen interest for the East Asian area (notably South Korea and Japan).\nFeel free to reach out to me using the following address :  “romain.fernex” followed by “@sciencespo.fr”"
